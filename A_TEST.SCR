; This is a test file that will step your motors
; through a simulated Auto_scroll around the sky.
; To use this test program :
;
;   #1 Start Scope.exe  
;   #2 press "s" to see a list of the scroll files available
;   #3 press the "letter" that is in front of "a_test.scr"
;      This is usually the "a" key.  The name of the file
;      will be displayed in the lower left hand of the screen
;      as it is loaded into the program.  If you get it wrong
;      just press "s" again and load the correct file.  You 
;      can restart this test at any time by reloading the test
;      file and going to step #4. 
;   #4 press "b" to begin the program ..... the motors will 
;      start moving instantly.  If no motors are moving, you 
;      are either sitting at the first target already or something
;      is wrong.
;   #5 watch the lower left hand screen for what the system
;      is doing at any given moment.  Every 5 seconds the motors
;      should go from snail's pace (track mode) to haul butt 
;      and get that next target pace (aquire mode).  
;      
;      You may want to concider first reseting  
;      the system to ( Ra=13hrs / Dec=30deg )
;      to reduce the amount of motor running time
;      it will take to get to the first target in the test.
;
;      Each target in the test (after the first) will take 
;      about 5 seconds to get to.  The pause is 5 seconds   
;      between each target.  The motors will turn off at the
;      end of the test.
;
;      The program will auto scroll and turn on the stepper
;      motors (tracking mode) all by itself.  This is only 
;      a test of the automated system.  Manual control of the 
;      system would require you to delete the "Auto_scroll"
;      command in the file and press the "l" key every time 
;      you want to advance to the next line of the program.
;
;      Manual mode may require two clicks to get to the next 
;      target in the list.  One to move the motors and one to 
;      execute the pause command and see the message
;
;
;      The program start with the next line of programing code
